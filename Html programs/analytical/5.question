
5) Assume you are optimizing network buffer settings for a high-traffic web server to minimize latency and maximize throughput. You have collected the following data: 

1. The average time for a request to traverse the network from the client to the server is 50 milliseconds. 
2. The average processing time for each request on the server is 100 milliseconds. 
3. The server has a receive buffer size of 64 KB and a transmit buffer size of 32 KB. 
4. Each client connection requires 8 KB of buffer space for both receiving and transmitting data. 
Based on this information, calculate the following: 
a) The total time spent in network transit for a request before it starts being processed on the server. 
b) The total buffer space required for 100 concurrent client connections. 
c) If you want to reduce the total buffer space required for 100 concurrent client connections by 20%, what adjustments can you make sizes, assuming the buffer proportions remain the same? 

ANSWER:;
     
      
      Given Data:
Network Transit Time: 50 milliseconds (time for a request to travel from the client to the server).
Server Processing Time: 100 milliseconds (time the server takes to process a request).
Buffer Sizes:
Receive Buffer Size: 64 KB.
Transmit Buffer Size: 32 KB.
Per Client Buffer Usage:
8 KB for receiving data.
8 KB for transmitting data (total 16 KB per client).
a) The Total Time Spent in Network Transit for a Request Before It Starts Being Processed on the Server
This is simply the time taken for the request to travel from the client to the server.

Network Transit Time = 50 milliseconds.
b) The Total Buffer Space Required for 100 Concurrent Client Connections
For each client connection, the total buffer space is:

Receive Buffer: 8 KB per client.
Transmit Buffer: 8 KB per client.
Total Buffer per Client = 8 KB (receive) + 8 KB (transmit) = 16 KB per client.
For 100 concurrent client connections:

Total Buffer Space for 100 Clients = 100 * 16 KB = 1600 KB (or 1.6 MB).
c) Adjustments to Reduce the Total Buffer Space by 20%
To reduce the total buffer space by 20%, you need to reduce the total buffer space required for 100 concurrent clients to 80% of the current total.

Current Buffer Space: 1600 KB.
Desired Buffer Space = 1600 KB * 0.8 = 1280 KB.
This means you need to reduce the buffer usage by 320 KB (1600 KB - 1280 KB).

Since the buffer sizes for receiving and transmitting data are proportionate (both are 8 KB per client), reducing the buffer sizes proportionally will maintain the ratio. Therefore, the total buffer space per client should be reduced by 20%.

New Buffer per Client = 16 KB * 0.8 = 12.8 KB per client.
This means you would:

Receive Buffer per Client = 8 KB * 0.8 = 6.4 KB.
Transmit Buffer per Client = 8 KB * 0.8 = 6.4 KB.
For 100 clients:

Total Buffer Space for 100 Clients = 100 * 12.8 KB = 1280 KB (as desired).
